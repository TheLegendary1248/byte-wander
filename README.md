# Byte Wander
A simple infinite brick breaker game that uses the PC's files as levels  
Simple as that, the game turns the files it reads on the user's system into levels, jumping files relatively close when EOF is reached.

Funny enough, seems I only got to work on it for a week until something else had to come up
